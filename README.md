# Coniculator
This application was my final project during my second-year college for my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course.
It is a PyQt5 Application for calculating values (e.g., center, foci, vertices, length of latus rectum, eccentricity, etc.) needed given a template conic equations to plot the following conic shapes:

Subsequentely, the values calculated are used for graphing the selected conic shape.

QtDesigner was not used during the development for us to fully understand libraries or frameworks that implements OOP for their modules.
